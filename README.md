The techniques and methods for solving systems of linear
algebraic equations belongs to two fundamentally different approaches :
 1. Elimination approach
 2. Iterative approach

Elimination approach is also known as direct method. 
Gauss-Jordan method is one of the most populer method.
Direct methos pose some problem when the systems grow 
larger or when most of the coifficent are zero. They 
require prohibitively large number of floating  point 
operation and, therefor , not only become time consuming 
but also severely affect the accuracy of the solution due 
to roundoff errors.

Iterative methods provide an alternative. For instant, ill-condition 
systems can be solved by iterative methods without facing the problem 
of roundoff errors.
 1.Jacobi iteratiion method
 2.Gauss-Seidel iteration method
 3.Successive over relaxation method
 those are the most populer method of Iterative methods
 


Those methods are described in the book 'Numerical Method' by E Balagurusamy
